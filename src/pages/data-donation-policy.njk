          The best way to donate a database is to fill out our online data form (link it to the online form on the website) which will allow you to send us a link to the data base or to directly upload it into our repository, as applicable. Alternatively, a donation of a database may be made by doing an anonymous ftp of donated files to our incoming directory. For instructions, please contact <a href="mailo:adm@breachreport.com">adm@breachreport.com</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="col-12 text-justify">
          After FTPing your files, please send an email to adm@breachreport.com. You may also send us the data as an email attachment if the database is small enough (we do not provide any representations as to the maximum size of database which can be sent through email), or you may point us to a place on the web that contains the data that you are donating.
